# Unbound by Limits

Anyone and everyone can become successful in life. Success is not restricted to only those who come from a family of wealth, go to prestigious schools, or have the best upbringing. All those tools listed can help you become successful, but like most things in life...it is not guaranteed.

This blog and its purpose are to help show you that you can be someone great regardless of your background. I am a self-taught web developer who knew nothing of the tech world before learning to code at my first internship, so the fear of not becoming successful was immensely high. What was it that allowed me to overcome that fear and persevere? Two quotes really helped shaped my mindset when pursuing this career path and they are:

>***“Life has no limitations except for the ones YOU make.” - Les Brown***

>***"Confucius said: 'He who says he can and he who says he can't are both usually right,' " Smith said. "You can call it naiveté, you can call it arrogance. Barack Obama called it the audacity of hope. The first step before anybody else in the world believes it is you have to believe it. Failure is not an option. There's no reason to have a plan B 'cause it distracts from plan A." - Will Smith***

There are two key points to take away from the quotes mentioned above. The first is that **YOU** get to decide how great and successful you can be. The resources to assist you in that will come in time, but you have to take the first step in establishing that idea that you can actually do it. The second is that limitations are self-imposed meaning that we create them and we can destroy them too. Knowing that I can do anything in the world and genuinely believing I could accomplish it no matter what is what helped me become a developer despite being self-taught.

Your journey may be different from mine in terms of careers, but the idea of you becoming great and successful in that chosen career shouldn't be. No one can make the decision for you to achieve everything you ever wanted in life, but we can rally behind you and cheer you on as you begin that journey after that decision is made. You were born on this planet and that alone makes you unique because there is only one of you. Do not be afraid to share that uniqueness with the world because there isn't a thing you can't do. I will end it with the following words.

You don’t have to write code, be a millionaire, become the next CEO of a famous company, or even change the world. Define the idea of success that makes the most sense in your own life. Become the best you there is and in every aspiration, you seek. Foster that greatness inside you because you deserve to be successful, happy, and limitless.
